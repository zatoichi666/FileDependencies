Spring 2013, CSE-687

Usage:
1. 	To verify the test package, 
	a. 	Run the compile.bat script in the test folder.
	b. 	Run the run.bat script in the test folder.

2. 	To verify the display package, 
	a. 	Run the compile.bat script in the test folder.
	b. 	Run the run.bat script in the test folder.

See Requirements Trace Matrix for verification guidance:

Notes:
1. 	Do not delete the Debug folder in Submission\display\.  It contains
files that are needed for demonstrating the project.

2. 	Warnings present themselves when compiling test package: the unmodified 
testbracebug.cpp and semiexpression.cpp.  These files have been left 
unmodified, so the warnings are expected.
